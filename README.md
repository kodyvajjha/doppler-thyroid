# Doppler-thyroid

This project is a simple data analysis of the effect of the Doppler ultrasound in predicting malignant thyroid nodules. 

The data is given in `MS- 15-9- HALO, NAMES AGE DITED.xlsx`.
It contains 134 observations and 20 variables. The dependent variable is "FINAL.DIAGNOSIS".

The results of the data analysis is given in the pdf file : `output(4).pdf`

The main steps in the analysis was Sensitivity and Specificity analysis of the variables, Association analysis of variables and the dependent variable through Cross tabulation and Chi-square and finally a logistic regression model. 

All of the analysis was carried out in R. The code is given in the file `MS_code.R` 

It was found that the variable Resistive Index (RI) is quite a powerful indicator of malignancy. But is it significant?
